*Course Description *

This is a one-semester overview of topics in Bioinformatics including
analysis of nucleotide and peptide sequence data, sequence alignment
algorithms, molecular phylogeny, analysis of transcriptome data,
proteomics, protein structure analysis, and regulatory bioinformatics.
Emphasis is on experimental methods and analytical approaches. The
course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates.

*Course Goals*

In today's post-genomic world of biological research, the scientist is
awash in data as never before. This data is in the form of DNA and
polypeptide sequences, data from genomic and transcriptomic
applications, as well as protein structures and phenotypic variation,
all of which must be integrated and analyzed together. Furthermore,
high-throughput sequencing technology has brought us to the doorstep of
the personal genomics revolution. This brings with it not just another
big data explosion but the need for robust and meaningful analytical
tools. These developments have solidified and diversified the uses of
basic bioinformatics techniques in basic biological and biomedical
research. The broad goal of this course is to introduce the student to
the methods of several bioinformatics sub-disciplines including sequence
alignments, phylogenetic analysis, genome function annotation, secondary
and tertiary protein structural analyses, and transcriptomic and
proteomic analyses.

*Recommended Background *

BIOL:2512 or BIOC:3120 or MICR:3170.

*TILE Format*

This course is taught in the University's TILE format: Transform,
Interact, Learn, Engage. The TILE project facilitates lively
interaction, enhanced learning, increased faculty/student engagement,
and student-centered, active learning. TILE rooms are equipped with
circular tables, laptops, flat screen monitors and whiteboards to
support collaboration and active learning. This free-flowing learning
environment is well suited to small group work and ideal for learning to
use diverse bioinformatic applications to solve various analytical
challenges.

Our particular TILE classroom's computers have been preconfigured for
our bioinformatics activities. Most of the software applications that
will be introduced during the TILE sessions are either available online
or easily installable on personal computers for use and practice outside
of the TILE sessions and will be mentioned as we go along. As a courtesy
to your classmates and instructors, we ask you to refrain from using
computers, phones, and other electronic devices for purposes unrelated
to course activities.

Teaching Approach

Our 2-hour Tuesday and Thursday afternoon meetings will follow a regular
routine. Sessions will be devoted to workshops and lectures as described
in the chart below. Tuesday sessions will consist of 25' of lecture and
~ 65' of workshop activities. Each workshop will involve a short
introduction, group work, and a presentation / discussion period.
Thursday sessions will include a 15' quiz over the readings and lectures
for that week, 25' of lecture and 55' of workshop activities. Any
remaining time will be spent working on or reporting on student project
activities (Tuesdays) or describing and demonstrating the next set of HW
exercises, project activities, and relevant tools (Thursdays).

cover the assigned readings for that week and all material covered
during the previous two lectures (the previous Tuesday and the Thursday
of the preceding week).

Textbooks & Readings

*1. REQUIRED TEXTBOOK (X): /Essential Bioinformatics./ Author: Jin
Xiong*

Publication Date: March 13, 2006 | ISBN-10: 0521600820 | ISBN-13:
978-0521600828 |

Available online (link from the course webpage)

From the publisher's description: “Essential Bioinformatics is a concise
yet comprehensive textbook of bioinformatics, which provides a broad
introduction to the entire field. Written specifically for a life
science audience, the basics of bioinformatics are explained, followed
by discussions of the state-of-the-art computational tools available to
solve biological research problems. All key areas of bioinformatics are
covered including biological databases, sequence alignment, genes and
promoter prediction, molecular phylogenetics, structural bioinformatics,
genomics and proteomics. The book emphasizes how computational methods
work and compares the strengths and weaknesses of different methods.
This balanced yet easily accessible text will be invaluable to students
who do not have sophisticated computational backgrounds. Technical
details of computational algorithms are explained with a minimum use of
mathematical formulae; graphical illustrations are used in their place
to aid understanding. The effective synthesis of existing literature as
well as in-depth and up-to-date coverage of all key topics in
bioinformatics make this an ideal textbook for all bioinformatics
courses taken by life science students and for researchers wishing to
develop their knowledge of bioinformatics to facilitate their own
research.”

Theme Project Genome

Each year, students in the course learn to apply bioinformatics methods
to a gene or gene family from a newly sequenced genome of an organism or
class of organisms. This year students will develop gene projects based
on the recently sequenced genome of the +tiger tail seahorse,
/Hippocampus comes/+. Homeworks, and a project presentation and report
will be based on this gene project. Additional information will be
introduced at the beginning of the semester.

*Academic Misconduct*

The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences considers academic fraud,
dishonesty, and cheating serious academic misconduct. All students
suffer when academic misconduct takes place. Academic fraud, dishonesty,
and cheating disturb the mutual respect that should exist between
instructors and students and among students, and can poison the
atmosphere of a classroom. Perhaps most seriously, those who commit
academic fraud, dishonesty, or cheating are robbed of the educational
experiences that are the primary purposes of course work in the College
of Liberal Arts and Sciences. We expect instructors to help students
understand and avoid all academic fraud.

If you are unclear about the proper use and citation of sources, or the
details and guidelines for any assignment, you should discuss the
assignment and your questions with the instructor. All forms of
plagiarism and any other activities that result in a student presenting
work that is not really his or her own are considered academic fraud.
Academic fraud includes these and other misrepresentations: presentation
of ideas from any sources you do not credit; the use of direct
quotations without quotation marks and without credit to the source;
paraphrasing information and ideas from sources without credit to the
source; failure to provide adequate citations for material obtained
through electronic research downloading and submitting work from
electronic databases without citation; participation in a group project
which presents plagiarized materials; taking credit as part of a group
without participating as required in the work of the group; submitting
material created/written by someone else as one's own, including
purchased term/research papers;

Cheating on examinations and other work also interferes with your own
education as well as the education of others in your classes. If you are
unclear about the guidelines for any testing situation or assignment,
you should discuss your questions with the instructor. Academic cheating
includes all of the following, and any other activities that give a
student an unfair advantage in course work: copying from someone else's
exam, homework, or laboratory work; allowing someone to copy or submit
your work as his/her own; accepting credit for a group project without
doing your share; submitting the same paper in more than one course
without the knowledge and approval of the instructors involved; using
notes, text messaging, cell phone calls, pre-programmed formulae in
calculators, or other materials during a test or exam without
authorization; not following the guidelines specified by the instructor
for a "take home" test or exam.

When an instructor in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences suspects
a student of academic fraud or cheating these procedures will be
followed: The instructor (or supervisor, if the instructor is a teaching
assistant) must inform the student--in a printed letter--as soon as
possible after the incident has been observed or discovered. If the
instructor comes to the conclusion that the student academic fraud or
cheating has occurred, he or she (in consultation with the supervisor if
the instructor is a teaching assistant) will determine what action to
take. The instructor may decide to reduce the student's grade on the
assignment or activity, or in the course, or even to assign an F for the
assignment or activity or for the course The instructor will send a
written report of the case to the Associate Dean for Academic Programs
and send copies of the report to the DEO and to the student(s) involved
The associate dean for academic programs will impose the following or
other penalties: disciplinary warning until graduation (usually for a
first offense); suspension from the college for a calendar year or
longer (usually for a second offense); or recommendation of expulsion
from the University by the president (usually for a third offense). If a
student believes that the finding of academic fraud or cheating is in
error or the penalty unjust, he or she may request information on appeal
procedures from CLAS Academic Programs & Services, 120 Schaeffer Hall.

IMPORTANT POLICIES OF THE COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES

*Academic Fraud\\
*Plagiarism and any other activities involving students presenting work
that is not their own is academic fraud. Academic fraud is a serious
matter and is reported to the departmental DEO and to the Associate Dean
for Undergraduate Programs and Curriculum. Instructors and DEOs decide
on appropriate consequences at the departmental level while the
Associate Dean enforces additional consequences at the collegiate level.
See the CLAS Academic Fraud section of the
[[http://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code][Student
Academic Handbook.]]

*CLAS Final Examination Policies*

Final exams may be offered only during finals week. No exams of any kind
are allowed during the last week of classes. Students should not ask
their instructor to reschedule a final exam since the College does not
permit rescheduling of a final exam once the semester has
begun. Questions should be addressed to the Associate Dean for
Undergraduate Programs and Curriculum.

*Electronic Communication*\\
University policy specifies that students are responsible for all
official correspondences sent to their University of Iowa e-mail address
(@uiowa.edu). Faculty and students should use this account for
correspondences. Link for additional information on the CLAS website can
be found
[[http://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/teaching-policies-resources-syllabus-insert][/here/]].

*Making a Suggestion or a Complaint*\\
Students with a suggestion or complaint should first visit the
instructor, then the course supervisor, and then the departmental DEO.
Complaints must be made within six months of the incident. See the CLAS
[[http://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook][/Student Academic
Handbook./]]

*Accommodations for Disabilities*

The University of Iowa is committed to providing an educational
experience that is accessible to all students. A student may request
academic accommodations for a disability (which include but are not
limited to mental health, attention, learning, vision, and physical or
health-related conditions). A student seeking academic accommodations
should first register with Student Disability Services and then meet
with the course instructor privately in the instructor's office to make
particular arrangements. Reasonable accommodations are established
through an interactive process between the student, instructor, and SDS.
See
http://[[https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/][sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/]]
for information. 

*Understanding Sexual Harassment*

Sexual harassment subverts the mission of the University and threatens
the well-being of students, faculty, and staff. All members of the UI
community have a responsibility to uphold this mission and to contribute
to a safe environment that enhances learning. Incidents of sexual
harassment should be reported immediately. See
[[http://sexualharassment.uiowa.edu/][/the UI Comprehensive Guide on
Sexual Harassment/]] for assistance, definitions, and the full
University policy.

*Administrative Home\\
*The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is the administrative home of
this course and governs matters such as the add/drop deadlines, the
second-grade-only option, and other related issues. Different colleges
may have different policies. Questions may be addressed to 120 Schaeffer
Hall, or see the CLAS
[[http://www.clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/][/Student Academic
Handbook./]]

*Reacting Safely to Severe Weather\\
*In severe weather, class members should seek appropriate shelter
immediately, leaving the classroom if necessary. The class will continue
if possible when the event is over. For more information on Hawk Alert
and the siren warning system, visit the Public Safety website.
